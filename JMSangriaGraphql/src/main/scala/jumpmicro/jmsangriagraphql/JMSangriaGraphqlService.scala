  * The trait which is exposed by this OSGi component.

  * Normal OSGi works by having a bundle expose a Java interface, in this case a trait is a Java interface.
  * The trait exposes the interface the OSGi bundle implements. The implementation is hidden in the impl package
  * folder.
  *
  * Rename this to YourNameService where YourName is the name of
  * the service you are providing. You would also want to rename the osgidemo package to com.yourpackage
  *
  * Trait(s) should exist here in this for the services the OSGi component is exposing.
